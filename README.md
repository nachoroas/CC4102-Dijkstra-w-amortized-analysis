# Dijkstra-w-amortized analysis

This project is about the efficiency of dijkstra algorithm using two types of queues for the graph nodes

## Installation

To create an executable to run the code you have to run "g++ main.cpp" in the terminal, after that you can run the executable with "./a.out"

To do this you will need a C++ compiler

## Usage

After running the executable, you will be prompted the following results:

For each combination of possible graph:

- Average search time of heap use
- Standard deviation of heap use time
- Average search time of Fibonacci use
- Standard deviation of Fibonacci use time
  All time-related measurements will be in microseconds.

Finally, the algorithm ends.
